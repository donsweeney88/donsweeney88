This is the final group capstone as it was submitted to Tech Elevator.  In a group of 5, we were tasked with creating a website,
that suggested different walkable locations within the limits of the city of Cleveland proper.  The project was completed with agile
methodolgy with different staff acting as Scrum master and Product Owner.  The backend was built in Java using Boot Strap to access our data
from Postgres SQL.  The front end was created using Vue.JS, JavaScript, and CSS.

It quickly became apparent during the project that I had the most technical experience and availability and the burden of the design fell 
on me.  I do not say this to disparage my team, who contributed as they could, but to help explain some of the restraints we were operating
under.  While it was important to me to have a finished product, it was also important to me to make sure my team could gain what knowledge
and skills that they could from this experience.  While juggling the hats of a designer and educator as a student at Tech Elevator was not easy,
it was a necessary and worthy endevor for the heart of the project and the program itself. 

None of my team felt comfortable in the back-end at all, and the Java portion was built entirely by me, while the team gathered images,
the data we would need (descriptions, hours, location data) and tried to work on the google maps API.  They were also able to upload our data in our
database with guidance. The map unfortunately was never able to fully integrate with our site and the API key has been removed to avoid fees.

Unfortunately, my team wasn't very comfortable with the Vue framework, and I had to design most of that as well.  Once a framework was in place they were
able to help style, and make other smaller changes.  Once similar logic was created, one teammate was able to create the system that allowed us to import
user provided photos.  Due to the restrictions mentioned above, we didn't have time to refactor the project properly or complete all the desired features.

I'm currently working on refactoring and upgrading the project, and the updates will be available on github for comparisson.
